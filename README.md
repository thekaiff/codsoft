# CodSoft Internship Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository containing the Python projects I developed during my virtual internship at CodSoft. This repository showcases three projects that demonstrate various programming skills and concepts.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Simple Calculator
- **Description:** A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project emphasizes fundamental programming logic and user input handling.
- **Skills:** Python basics, Control flow, Arithmetic operations, User input.

### 2. Contact Book
- **Description:** A contact management system where users can add, search, update, and delete contacts. This project highlights the use of classes, lists, and file handling in Python.
- **Skills:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data management, CRUD operations, Python lists, File I/O.

### 3. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
- **Description:** A classic rock-paper-scissors game where the user competes against the computer. This project demonstrates the use of randomization, conditional statements, and user interaction in Python.
- **Skills:** Random module, Conditional statements, Loops, User interaction.

## How to Run the Projects

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thekaiff/CodSoft.git
   cd CodSoft

2. Navigate to the project directory and run the respective Python script:
    ```bash
    python simple_calculator.py
    python contact_book.py
    python rock_paper_scissors.py

## Future Improvements
Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for the calculator and contact book.
Enhancing the contact book with database integration.
Expanding the rock-paper-scissors game with additional features and options.

## Acknowlegment
I want to thank CodSoft for the valuable learning opportunity and the support provided throughout the internship. These projects have helped me enhance my Python skills and gain practical experience.

Feel free to explore the code, and if you have any suggestions or improvements, don't hesitate to create a pull request!
